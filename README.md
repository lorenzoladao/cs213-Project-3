# Tuition Manager

In this project, I developed a GUI (graphical user interface) with JavaFX for the Tuition Manager. The manager has 3 functions: Updating Student Profiles, Updating Student Payment/Financial Aid, and Printing the Roster. 

Student Profiles: The user creates a profile for a student that consists of a Name, Major, Status (Resident, Nonresident International, or Nonresident Tristate), and Credit Hours. You can add, or remove students from the roster and change whether they are study abroad. When creating a student, the tuition due will be calculated based on how many credits they take and the status of the student. You can also update tuition due for a specific student or all students if a payment is made.

Payments/Financial Aid: For a specific student you can make a payment setting an amount and date for the payment. You can also set financial aid for a student which will reduce the tuition due.

Print Roster: There are 3 different ways to print the roster: Print in the order that students were entered, Print the roster by name, and Print the roster by last updated tuition date.
